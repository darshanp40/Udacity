Dear Darshan,
Every person who is hard-working and has a goal towards the success of life, will get problems in between. Problems are the going to come, but if you see positively, the problems only, will help you grow in life. So, not to worry.
Just take a breath. Have two or three cup of coffee and bring your problem statement onto the paper.
Try to find out specific solutions to the problem from stack overflow or any other dev portal. List them out.
Try out those solutions and try to fit them as a solution to your problem.
If none of these ever help you out, then the most resourceful source would be the forums on Udacity, which would have programmers who already might have faced this problem.
But if you get success in the previous work, you will have something very appreciation and that will help you grow your self-confidence.

Thanks,
Darshan
